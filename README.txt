hi if you see this you are probably on github.
or scraping the gh pages deployment.

i have kept the /a/ directory for compatibility
with my using it in person to direct people to
methods of contacting me.
this is not structured well, which i know.
if anyone knows about any way to route pages
(i.e. [site]/about -> [site]/a/aboutme.html)
please make a pr. i really need to clean this up.
also if possible, i want to avoid js because
js is pretty cringe, and i dont want to call on
some ext domain for site functionality.

if you do, i wont mail you a cookie (2 weeks +
possible fees) but i will create a shoutout page
and you will be included -- if you want to commit
but not be included, email me or contact me in
some other way. -s
