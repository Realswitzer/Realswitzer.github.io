    <p>hi, if you are reading this you were probably sent this by me
      <br>anyways some things for discord and some explanations.
      <br>
      <br>main points:
      <br>no personal information, don't share my info, no names.
      <br>
      <br>so in general, i dont want anything personal.
      <br>discord is not e2e, or really encrypted in any capacity,
      <br>so no names (refer to me via online name, please.), no
      <br>shit doxxes (i will do it myself when the time comes),
      <br>etc. when i finally make guides for how to use matrix, xmpp,
      <br>or whatever e2e chat protocol/platform i decide to adopt,
      <br>then i will be fine with my personal information there --
      <br>at least when not shared with randos. also for people who
      <br>might know me in "real life", please do not share my info
      <br>around. this is for my privacy and safety from massive
      <br>corporations and government entities as much as it for you.
      <br>also try not to seem like a dick by saying "i have switz's
      <br>information!!!" and especially try not to dox(x?) me.
      <br>
      <br>if my account is banned, please check about me page.
      <br>assuming that they dont autoban, i will update that.
      <br>-switz
