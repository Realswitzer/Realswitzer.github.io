maybe eventually will ditch discord, but as of now,
nobody uses better alternatives like simplex or session.
when i eventually decide to ditch it,
ill try providing some warning ahead of time,
though im unable to ensure that.
depends on if i get termed or not when i make up my mind.

to something hopefully less bad,
especially after working on html just
a bit more. might work on it more
eventually but wont contain js
