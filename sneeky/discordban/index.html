    <p>so discord tempbanned my account for a bad reason and refused to look at my appeal because "i was gonna get unbanned soon" where soon = about 2 days. i think this is the part where i shill some random vpn that everyone else shills because they pay too much money for normal people to turn down. well good thing im not paid or able to shill something and get people to get it for my own personal gain in the short term. meanwhile the company thats paying people to shill everything spends money but has people pay too much because "oh everyone is shilling this product so therefore its good and ill spend money on it!" when its quite simply the opposite of what they think, and then companies use them as a user as +1 to the user statistic to help convince other people to try it because "oh yeah look theres 3 million users, therefore its good, right?" no. you are far from the truth. wake up. revolt against massive companies. make your own vpn. "oh but its more! i can just spend money on [some shilled vpn here] thats way cheaper." you expect me to pay for nord when they have had a data breach? no. you expect me to use a normal vpn like expressvpn? no. you expect me to use some random "free lifetime vpn"? the answer is clear. no. only free vpn i might shill despite being unpaid is proton but even then their company history is sketchy with protonmail glowing and tracking some people involved in a criminal investigation for the governments help. "oh yeah so private." if you are behind a multihop vpn, theres so little point. all of them are from the same company. if they have access to one, then they have access to all. "oh but it protects against hackermans trying to steal my password" yeah go shove the egotistical claims from the companies right in the dumpster. is it safer? depends. it can be safer from external people but realistically from the biggest threat of glowies, it does nothing. you would have better privacy using carrier pigeons or sending butterflies with dna to send files to other people. this went way off track, so i will stop here. thanks for reading i guess, im not insane.
